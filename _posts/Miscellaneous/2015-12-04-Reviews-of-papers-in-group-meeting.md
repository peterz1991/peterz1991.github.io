In the summer of 2015, our imaging group has a regular weekly meeting and presentation on many papers. Here is some slides I have presented. _Many of them are unpolished and the code is only for simple demonstration purpose, so read and use them on your own risk._

- ### ADMM

Review of 

>'Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers' by Stephen Boyd et al.

Here is the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/ADMM_review.pdf).

There are much nice related code in <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html" target="_blank">Boyd's website</a>.


- ### FISTA

Review of

>'A Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm for Linear Inverse
Problems' by Beck and Teboulle 2008.

Here is the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/FISTA_review.pdf).


- ### Total Fractional-Order Variation Model for Image Processing

Review of 

>'A Total Fractional-Order Variation Model for Image Restoration with Non-homogeneous Boundary Conditions and its Numerical Solution' by Jianping Zhang, Ke Chen (2015).

Here is the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/Total Fractional Order Variational Model_review.pdf).
Some code written by myself： [download code]({{ site.url }}/assets/TFV_code.zip).


- ### Polynomial Annihilation for Non-uniform Fourier data

Review of

>'Image Reconstruction from Undersampled Fourier Data Using the Polynomial Annihilation Transform' by R.Archibald, A.Gelb and R.B.Platte (2015).

Here is the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/UnderSampled Fourier.pdf).

Some code written by myself： [download code]({{ site.url }}/assets/PA_code.zip).


- ### Frame Theory

Review of 

>materials in 2015 IMA summer school: modern harmonic analysis and its applications.

Here is the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/Frames.pdf).



- ### Mean Curvature Regularization

Review of 

> 'Augmented Lagrangian Method for A Mean Curvature Based Image Denoising Model' by Wei Zhu, Xue-Cheng Tai and Tony Chan (2013).

Here is the [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/ALM for Mean Curvature.pdf).
