Everything of Coding
====================================
- [Awesome Series on Github]("https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome"). Basically you can find everything about coding here. It's a collection of awesome projects!


Compressive Sensing
=====================================
- [Nuit Blanche]("http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/"). If you are telling me that you do some compressive sensing but you never heard about Nuit Blanche, you should probably do your homework again.
- Compressive Sensing Group at Rice Univ. Unfortunately, recently they moved the website to another place where I could not find.

Optimization
================================

- Convex Optimization
    + [Convex Optimization I (EE364a) at Stanford by Stephen Boyd]("http://stanford.edu/class/ee364a/"). Oh Stephen, my idol.
    + [Convex Optimization I (EE364b) at Stanford by Stephen Boyd]("http://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/")
    + [Advanced Topics in Convex Optimization (Math 301) at Stanford by Candes]("http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/math301/")
    + [Optimization at CMU by Javier Pe√±a and Ryan Tibshirani]("http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/")
- Nice blogs
    + [An Overview of Gradient Descent Algorithms]("http://sebastianruder.com/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html"). From a machine learning student's perspective.


Statistical Machine Learning
====================================

- [Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani]("http://online.stanford.edu/course/statistical-learning-winter-2014"). Pretty cool! Two funny old guys XD (and of course the giants of our time)
- [Statistical Machine Learning by Larry Wasserman and Ryan]("http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/"). Larry is genius. You should take some time to check this out.
- [Advanced Machine Learning by Robert Nowak]("http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/cs761/") and also many interesting courses on his web.
